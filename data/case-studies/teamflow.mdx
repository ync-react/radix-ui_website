**Describe the type of project you are using Radix on?**

Teamflow is the all-in-one collaboration hub where remote teams meet, brainstorm, and do the best work of their lives. We're mixing WebGL, WebRTC and React, pushing the web to the limits. This means performance is critical to us. We use Radix as a fast and accessible foundation for our design system.

**In what ways has Radix helped you and your company?**

We started with a ready-made UI library to move fast, but soon ran into blocking performance issues. Once we adopted Radix, we saw a noticeable performance improvement. We began by replacing modals and tooltips, and we saw big gains right away. It was also faster to adapt components to our design team’s specifications. Radix allows us to spend more time focusing on our core product.

**What are your thoughts on Radix developer experience?**

The headless UI model is easy to adopt. We never had to fight the library to apply our custom styles to it. Radix compatibility with any CSS layer is great. We needed a zero runtime CSS library, and we were able to integrate Vanilla Extract in no time. The API of Radix components is well-designed and consistent, while also being easy to learn and maintain.

**What are your thoughts on Radix docs?**

The docs are clear and concise. The "anatomy" sections are helpful in figuring out how to use a certain component. The Github source links are great for when we want to dig deeper. Keyboard interactions are well-documented. As a developer, you understand what's going on, there are no nasty surprises. The examples show real and complex use cases, not only the happy paths.
