          Mirrors the <Code>aria-relevant</Code> DOM attribute for live regions.
          It is an optional attribute used to describe what types of changes
          have occurred to the region, and which changes are relevant and should
          be announced. Any change that is not relevant acts in the same manner
          it would if the <Code>aria-live</Code> attribute were set to off.

          <br />
          Unfortunately, <Code>aria-relevant</Code> doesn't behave as expected across
          all device/screen reader combinations. It's important to test its implementation
          before relying on it to work for your users. The attribute is omitted by
          default.

          passing an id, you indicate that any content rendered by components with
          the same identifier should be mirrored in a separate <Code>
            aria-live
          </Code> region.
